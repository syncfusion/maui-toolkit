# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Syncfusion Toolkit for .NET MAUI! In this document, we'll outline what you need to know about contributing and how to get started.

Important: If you are considering a significant change or feature, please open an issue or talk to us first! This step allows us to coordinate and ensure that your intended change aligns with our current priorities and is something we can commit to reviewing and merging within a reasonable timeframe. We want to prevent you from investing a lot of valuable time in something that may not align with the toolkit's goals.

## Contributing Code

We are in the early stages of building the Syncfusion Toolkit for .NET MAUI, and we're excited for you to join us during this journey!

Please refer to our [Development Guide](DEVELOPMENT.md) for instructions on setting up your development environment. 

### What to Work On

If you're looking for tasks to tackle, please browse our [backlog](https://github.com/syncfusion/maui-toolkit/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3ABacklog). Any issue that is not already assigned is available for contribution.

Follow the coding style guidelines set by the [.NET Foundation](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/coding-guidelines/coding-style.md), with two primary exceptions:

- Default Accessibility: We do not use the private keyword, as it is the default accessibility level in C#.
- Tab vs. Spaces: We use hard tabs over spaces.


### Pull Request Requirements

Please refer to our [pull request template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) for details on how to format your submissions.

* **Allow Edits from Maintainers:** Ensure you check the "Allow edits from maintainers" checkbox on your pull request. This permission allows us to make minor fixes and resolve conflicts quickly.

## Review Process

All pull requests must be reviewed and tested by at least two members of the Syncfusion Toolkit for .NET MAUI team. We strive to review pull requests promptly, so please be patient! Once a PR is submitted, two reviewers will be assigned to initiate the review process.

* If changes are requested, please address them at your earliest convenience. If you cannot make further changes, let the reviewers know.
* If the PR requires only minor adjustments, another contributor may pick it up and complete it. We will ensure that all credit is retained for contributors.

## Merge Process

All PRs should target the main branch.
