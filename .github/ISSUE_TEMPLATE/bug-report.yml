        <segmentedControl:SfSegmentedControl.ItemsSource>
            <x:Array Type="{x:Type x:String}">
                <x:String>Day</x:String>
                <x:String>Week</x:String>
                <x:String>Month</x:String>
                <x:String>Year</x:String>
            </x:Array>
        </segmentedControl:SfSegmentedControl.ItemsSource>
        </segmentedControl:SfSegmentedControl>`
